# sntp_client

A tiny SNTP packet parser and client.

This crate doesnâ€™t use the standard library, and so requires the nightly Rust
channel.

## Usage

Get the source:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hashmismatch/sntp_client.rs
$ cd sntp_client
```

Then build:

```bash
$ cargo build
```

And test:

```bash
$ cargo test
```
